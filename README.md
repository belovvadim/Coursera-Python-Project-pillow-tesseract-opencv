# Python Project: pillow, tesseract, and opencv  

This is part of the [Python 3 Programming Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python-3-programming) by University of Michigan (on Coursera). The first 4 courses are a great way to learn the fundamental concepts and functioning of the language. The material is finalized by a more practical [hands-on project](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-project):

> You will be introduced to third-party APIs and will be shown how to manipulate images using the Python imaging library (pillow), how to apply optical character recognition to images to recognize text (tesseract and py-tesseract), and how to identify faces in images using the popular opencv library.

This repo contains jupyter notebook with results of the final assignment on image recogniton. This can be previewed, e.g., using [https://nbviewer.org/](https://nbviewer.org/).
